### ONI Example mods

A few very basic mods to help new modders get started. (Currently just one of them)  

**It is assumed you already read the ONI Modding Guide first which shows you how to set up for modding.**  
[The ONI Modding Guide](https://github.com/Cairath/Oxygen-Not-Included-Modding/wiki)

This is NOT a complete modding tutorial or documentation for the modding of Oxygen Not Included.  
I will not be adding examples to every single component or feature ONI can offer.  
This would simply be impossible.
